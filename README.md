# Visualization-Library
A series of modules to visualize data. Existing modules include pie, scatter, bar, and line charts

This is more easily viewed here.

Presently, the library is in its infancy. I'm figuring out best practices and standardizations I can do for each type of plot to make them scalable for easy use.

Some planned features are to include many different types of graphs - Pie, scatter, line, stacked area, bar, column, etc..
I also plan to include mathematical tools to interpret data, such as taking fourier transformations of appropriate datasets (see https://repl.it/@EngineerYo/Orbital-Period-animation), fourier transformations, shifting data to a polar plot, fitting data, generating voronoi sets from appropriate data, and much more.

I'm also playing around with animations in a separate repository to better tell the data's story.

Some examples of visualization currently available
